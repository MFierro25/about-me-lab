           <p>  <b>BIO</b><br>
                To begin my name is Miguel Fierro, Born in Los Angeles, CA but raised in the Seattle area.
                I have lived in Seattle almost all my life but before moving to the Evergreen state i lived in
                Mexico for 3 years. I have always been Moving around since i was a kid, i went to 10 different
                schools growing up which made me attend 4 different High schools. I am the oldest of 4 and i have two
                dogs. I dont really have any special skills but i do know how to play a couple songs i taught myself
                on the guitar and the bass. I also have been to 4 other countries and plan to visit more.

           <p>  <b>Education</b><br>
                After graduating high school i did not attend a University. But i did go to Edmonds Community College 
                for 2 quarters before deciding the traditional route was not for me and i joined the military. Once i 
                got out i recieved education benefits that i could not pass up so i went back to school for accounting and 
                almost finished my AA before i started working and put education to the side for a bit. After working in accounting
                for a bit i realized it was not for me and i got into programming and teaching myself to code which has led me
                here at Codefellows.

       <div class="exp">
            <p> <b>Experience</b><br>
                In high school i did all sorts of odd jobs. I have worked as a pizza delivery driver, in a grocery store, as a lube technician
                at Jiffy Lube and in fast food. to say ive done bit of everything is a bit of an understatement. Then i joined the 
                military and had my first real job as an Aviation Electrician workin on H60 helicopters. I spent most of my time in San Diego
                and if it was up to me i would go back. after my 4 years i returned and 
                started attending school and began working construction. I started my own Drywall business and became the one running 
                the books and doing the accounting for it, as well as bartend on Nights and weeknds. After the pandemic hit i stopped bartending 
                but kept working in drywall. I ended up closing the business after some unfortunate events but i kept doing the manual side 
                of the job. i knew that was not my future or passion so now i am doing what is possible to gain new experience in a new career.

       <div class="goals">
           <p>  <b>Goals</b><br>
                I have plenty of financial goals and personal health goals i would like to accomplish by the end of the year but i think
                my most important goal for this year is to finish this Codefellows course and eventually start a new career in programming.
                that is my main focus and goal for the rest of 2021.
